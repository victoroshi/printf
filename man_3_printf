.SH SYNOPSIS

#inlcude "main.h"
.PP
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
_printf produces output according to a specified format
.I format the string of characters based on user's input.
.PP
.B Print a string of characters folow by a new line
.RS
Format string is a character string that may begin or end in it's initial shift state, if any. It is composed of zero or more directives. These are:
.br
.B oridnary characters that are not ( % ) \- copied to the system and the value will remain unchanged
.br
.B conversion specifications \- result in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
.br

.B Conversion Specifications
are introduced using the character
.I %
and end with a
.B conversion specifier.
.PP
The arguments must must match conversion specifier.
.RE
.PP
.B Conversion specifiers
.RS
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.PP
.RS
.B d, i
.RS
An int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.RE

.PP
.RS i
.B c
.RS
If no l is present, the
.I int
argument is converted into an
.I unsigned char
and the resulting character is written.
.RE
.RE

.PP
.RS i
.B s
.RS
If no l modifier is present:
.I const char *
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of te character is
written. Characters from the array are written up to (but not including)
a terminating null byte ('\\0');
.RE
.RE

.PP
.RS i
.B b
.RS
An int argument is converted to binary.

.PP
.RS i
.B S
.RS
.I const char *
argument is expected to be an array of the characters is written. Non printable
characters are written in two digit hexadecimal notation preceded by a '\\x'.

.PP
.RS i
.B R
.RS
.I const char *
argument is expected to be an array of characters to be written. The characters are
printed in
.B rot13
encryption, upto, not inlcuding the null byte.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
Program will execute and retuen 0 on success and -1 on error.

.SH BUGS
The program can only correctly accepts few format specifiers and is in beta. Undefined specifiers will cause unexpected behaviour.
